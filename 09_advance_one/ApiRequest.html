    <h1>readyState</h1>
    The XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in. An XHR client exists in one of the following states:

Value	State	Description
0	UNSENT	Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1	OPENED	open() has been called.
2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3	LOADING	Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
4	DONE	The operation is complete.
</body>

    // ********************** XMLHttpRequest **********************
    const requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/er-deepak-ram'
    // XMLHttpRequest object have readyState property. And we can this object to send request 
    // to server and get response from server
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
    xhr.open('GET', requestUrl)

    // whenever readyState changes, this function will be called. And we can check the readyState value in this function
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        console.log(xhr.readyState) // 2, 3, 4
        if (xhr.readyState === 4) {

            // by default, response from server is in string format. But we can convert it to json format using JSON.parse() method
            const data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)
            
            console.log(`${data.name} have ${data.followers} followers on GitHub`) // Deepak Ram
            console.log(xhr.status) // 200
            
            /* "xhr.responseText" or this.responseText for getting the response?
                this:
                    Inside the callback function, this refers to the xhr object
                    *) Works because regular functions have their own this context
                xhr:
                    *) Relies on the closure to access the xhr variable from the outer scope

                Recommendation from claude:
                    *) Use this with regular functions (more conventional, cleaner)
                    *) Use xhr with arrow functions (only option that works)(because in arrow function
                        'this' is NOT the xhr object)
            */

    }
    // console.log(xhr.readyState) // 1
    xhr.send()
