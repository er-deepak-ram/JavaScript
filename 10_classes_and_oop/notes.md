# JavaScript and classes
JavaScript does have classes. However it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritancec mechanism. In other words, it provides a more familier syntax for developers coming from class based lannguages such as Java or C++, but under the hood, it works somewhat differently.
